To-Do
explain dataaset and goodreads like shelves and mayen images
need to split into test and train sets to properly evaluate

move functions in py file
review embdeddings for the cotnent filtering

the more fetaures in a model the less explianale it is 









Practical Application in Book Recommender Systems
User-User Collaborative Filtering:

Similarity: When comparing users based on their reading history (binary interactions), Jaccard or Dice-SÃ¸rensen similarity can identify users with shared interests.

Correlation: When comparing users based on their ratings, Pearson or Spearman correlation can be used to find users with similar rating behaviors.

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:

Similarity: When looking at books that users have interacted with (read or not read), cosine similarity can be used to measure the similarity between books based on user interactions.

Correlation: When analyzing ratings given to books, Pearson or Spearman correlation helps in identifying books that receive similar ratings across users.
