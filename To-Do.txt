To-Do
explain dataaset and goodreads like shelves and mayen images
need to split into test and train sets to properly evaluate
filtering out valid users but thats not realsistic and have ssen it  before
svd for user based collaborative
how to merge rating and review to get better input
use image?
how to filter out non english language

item based has table for every user
user down side and books along top with data being rating and review


if user has read no books/not in df
then use content filtering


a lot less lower ratings
sampling and bias
ranking metrics and graphs
nmf??
item item
what to do for top gernes


write up about annoy and tructaedsvd
if user has read < n books then call x if they have read > n then y and enough reviews
move functions in py file
review embdeddings for the cotnent filtering

the more fetaures in a model the less explianale it is 

1. Jaccard Similarity:

Usage: When comparing binary data, such as whether a user has read or not read a book.

Example: Two users, User A and User B, have read several books. Jaccard similarity can be used to determine how similar their reading habits are based on the overlap of books they've read.

Ideal For: Sparsely populated user-item interaction matrices, where the presence or absence of interactions is more relevant than the exact ratings.

2. Dice-Sørensen Similarity:

Usage: Similar to Jaccard, but gives more weight to the common items. Useful when emphasizing shared interactions.

Example: If we want to identify users who have a higher proportion of shared books in their reading history, Dice-Sørensen similarity would be effective.

Ideal For: Situations where the overlap of interactions is particularly significant.




Correlation Measures
1. Pearson Correlation:

Usage: Measuring the linear relationship between continuous variables, such as user ratings.

Example: Calculating the Pearson correlation between two users based on their ratings of books to identify users with similar rating patterns.

Ideal For: When the goal is to understand the strength and direction of the linear relationship between ratings.

2. Spearman Correlation:

Usage: Assessing the rank correlation between variables, useful for non-linear relationships.

Example: Comparing the ranked preferences of books between two users, regardless of the exact rating values.

Ideal For: Non-parametric data and when the relationship between variables is monotonic but not necessarily linear.

Practical Application in Book Recommender Systems
User-User Collaborative Filtering:

Similarity: When comparing users based on their reading history (binary interactions), Jaccard or Dice-Sørensen similarity can identify users with shared interests.

Correlation: When comparing users based on their ratings, Pearson or Spearman correlation can be used to find users with similar rating behaviors.

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:

Similarity: When looking at books that users have interacted with (read or not read), cosine similarity can be used to measure the similarity between books based on user interactions.

Correlation: When analyzing ratings given to books, Pearson or Spearman correlation helps in identifying books that receive similar ratings across users.
