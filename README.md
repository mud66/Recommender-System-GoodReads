# Recommender-System-GoodReads
******In Progress*****

Repository for undergrad thesis at University of York, graduating 2025

Using content and collaborative based filtering build a recommender system for the goodreads dataset

- dont include sequels of the book or movie
- how to properly evaluate a recommendation
- gridsearchcv
- hybrid approach

One important one to consider is the source of user preference, is it explicit (thumbs up, stars, ratings) or implicit (views, clicks, time spent, purchases).
